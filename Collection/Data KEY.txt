### KEY ---------------------------------------------------------
#### Notes
> heifers are females between one and two years old that have not given birth
> bred heifers are pregnant with their first calf
> cows have been mothers already
> bulls are males that have not been castrated
> steers are bulls that have been castrated

> The price column is the unit price

#### How Winter Livestock Categorized
> steer is coded as "str"
> heifer is coded as "hfr"
> bull is coded as "bull"
> cow is coded as "cow"

> angus is coded as "ang"
> limousin is coded as "lim"
> gelbvieh is coded as "gel"
> charolais is coded as "char"
> brahman is coded as "brah"
> hereford is coded as "here"
> saler is coded as "saler"

> any type with a hyphen is a cross breed
> the "x" in the Type column means nothing
> sim stands for "sim-angus"
> lim flex stands for "flex limousin"


#### My Simplifications, which were justified through EDA
> moved "str," "hfr," "bull," and "cow" to a new column, `Reprod`

> cattle whose only information was the color are coded as "clr"
> brahman and hereford cattle were assigned "clr" due to few observations
> bwf stands for "black white faced" but is lumped into the "clr" category (when not a subcategory)
> wf stands for "white faced" but is lumped into the "clr" category (when not a subcategory)
> rwf stands for "red white faced" but is lumped into the "clr" category (when not a subcategory)

> all cross breeds, including "balancer," are coded as "mix" (Ex. "char-ang" is recoded as "mix")
> cattle subcategories are stripped (Ex. "sim-angus" is recoded as "angus", "wf angus" is recoded as "angus", and "black angus" is recoded as "angus")
