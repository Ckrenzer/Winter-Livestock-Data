# Winter-Livestock-Data
Collects data from Winter Livestock La Junta Sale Tuesday reports
each week and organizes them into a csv. Updated Weekly.

This repository can only be updated after the folks over at
Winter Livestock release their market reports, meaning there will be
a few day's lag between the auction and new data in this repository.
