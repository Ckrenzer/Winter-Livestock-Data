# Introduction

The other files were getting pretty long, and I want to have a separate location to examine different parts of the data. I am happy with the organization of `La Junta Collection.Rmd`, but `La Junta Modeling.Rmd` and `La Junta Predictions.Rmd` seem like black boxes.


```{r setup-packages-data, include = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      results = "hide",
                      error = F,
                      warning = F,
                      message = F)


if(!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(dplyr, ggplot2, lubridate, readr, shiny, patchwork)


# Reading in the file and removing the URL column
lajunta <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ckrenzer/Winter-Livestock-Data/main/La%20Junta%20Market%20Reports.csv",
                    col_types = cols(Date = "D",
                                     Buyer = col_factor(),
                                     Quantity = col_double(),
                                     Type = col_factor(),
                                     Weight = col_double(),
                                     Price = col_double(),
                                     Reprod = col_factor())) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-URL)

```
