# This script is optional, though it will simplify your analysis

# There are two primary goals with this script:
#   1. Add column names to the csv
#   2. Organize types of cattle into a small number of distinct groups

# goal 1 is a piece of cake, but goal 2 is easier said than done.
# You can analyze some of my judgment calls and decide for
# yourself what needs to be done to group the different types
# of livestock.

# Should the header have been made beforehand and
# therefore not need this code? Probably. That sounds
# like a headache to implement if the file is already
# in your system, so a separate script seems easier.
